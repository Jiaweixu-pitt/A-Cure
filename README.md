# A-Cure: An Accurate Information Reconstruction from Inaccurate Data Sources
Storage and Share of A-Cure Matlab Code

This is the Matlab code for A-Cure. It applies 
  1. IP-EF-SRMSE method
  2. IP-Spike-SRMSE method
  3. IP-Cumulative-SRMSE method
  
  to dectect/delete noisy reports and reconstruct four disease data from aggregated reports set including both normal and noisy reports.

More detail for IP in reference: Xu, Jiawei, Vladimir Zadorozhny, and John Grant. "**IncompFuse**: a logical framework for historical information fusion with inaccurate data sources." Journal of Intelligent Information Systems (2019): 1-19.
We ran this code on Matlab R2018a.

**Input**

	disease data: Tycho.mat from https://www.tycho.pitt.edu
  
**Output**
	
	folder: ../output/
  
	result file: /output/Results_All.mat, including:
  
  	1. Accuracy:
  	-LSQ reconstruction applying noise detection/deletion with IP-EF-SRMSE method
  
  	2. All reconstruction RMSE including:
  	-hfuse and LSQ reconstruction	
  	-with noisy reports
  	-without noisy reports (clean)
  	-applying noise detection/deletion with IP-EF-SRMSE method
  
**Experimental Setup**:
	
	4 different disease

	4 different reports set with different noise setting. Details please check the paper.

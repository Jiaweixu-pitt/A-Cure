# A-Cure: An Accurate Information Reconstruction from Inaccurate Data Sources
Storage and Share of A-Cure Matlab Code

This is the Matlab code for A-Cure. It applies 
  1. IP-EF-SRMSE method (best of all three)
  2. IP-Spike-SRMSE method
  3. IP-Cumulative-SRMSE method
  
  to dectect/delete noisy reports and reconstruct four disease data from aggregated reports set including both normal and noisy reports.

## 1. How to run

1. Download/Close the A-Cure folder as A-Cure.zip.

2. Extract it and you should have A-Cure folder containing all code.

3. Open Matlab (We ran this code on Matlab R2018a), 
	- add the A-Cure folder to path, 
	- **click into** the A-Cure folder (A-Cure folder should be the "current folder" for Matlab. You can execute pwd() in the command window to check it),
	- delete the folder **outPut**. (if this fold not deleted, it will show a Warning when running the code, but it is ok)
	- execute the folowing command in the command window: run_A_Cure
	- the running process is:
